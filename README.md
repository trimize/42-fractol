# fractol


Graphical project to render fractals.
This project uses minilibx to draw the pixels, it is advised to use it on linux.
I have put on making the color shift as smooth as possible :)

## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/trimize/42-fractol.git && cd 42-fractol
```

## Usage

To create the sorting executable :

```bash
make
```

This will show a menu on the differents way to use the executable : 

![Alt text](./assets/menu_make.png?raw=true)

x and y are doubles.

When ran a second menu appears : 


![Alt text](./assets/run_menu.png?raw=true)


Example of Mandelbrot (test the sets and the keys binded, enjoy) :
